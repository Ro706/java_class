# Java Programming Language

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.

## Key Features of Java

- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**: Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
- **Object-Oriented**: Java is an object-oriented language which provides a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, reducing development costs.
- **Platform Independent**: Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform-specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the JVM.
- **Secure**: Java is secure because it supports the concept of byte code and exception handling.

## Example of Java Code

Here's a simple example of Java code that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
# Java Primitive Data Types

Java has 8 primitive data types, which are predefined by the language and named by a reserved keyword. These data types are used to create variables.

## Integral Data Types

1. **byte**: This is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. The range is from -128 to 127.
2. **short**: This is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. The range is from -32768 to 32767.
3. **int**: This is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. The range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. This is the default data type in Java.
4. **long**: This is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. The range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. When using this data type, add an "L" at the end of the number.

| Data Type | Description                  | Size (in bytes) |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| `byte`    | 8-bit signed integer         | 1               |
| `short`   | 16-bit signed integer        | 2               |
| `int`     | 32-bit signed integer        | 4               |
| `long`    | 64-bit signed integer        | 8               |
| `float`   | 32-bit floating-point number | 4               |
| `double`  | 64-bit floating-point number | 8               |
| `char`    | 16-bit Unicode character     | 2               |
| `boolean` | Represents true or false     | 1               |

## Floating Point Data Types

1. **float**: This is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Use an "f" at the end of the number.
2. **double**: This is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. This is the default data type for decimal values.

## Other Primitive Data Types

1. **char**: This is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
2. **boolean**: This data type has only two possible values: true and false.

## Non-Primitive Data Type

**String**: This is a sequence of characters. In Java, strings are immutable.

Here's an example of using these data types:

```java
byte a = 127;
short b = 32767;
int c = 2147483647;
long d = 9223372036854775807L;

float e = 3.14f;
double f = 3.14;

char g = 'a';
boolean h = true;

String i = "Hello, World!";
```

# Java escape sequences table

| Escape Sequence | Description                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `\\t`           | Represents a tab character    |
| `\\b`           | Represents a backspace       |
| `\\n`           | Represents a newline         |
| `\\r`           | Represents a carriage return |
| `\\'`           | Represents a single quotation mark |
| `\\"`           | Represents a double quotation mark |
| `\\\\`          | Represents a backslash       |
| `\\uXXXX`       | Represents a Unicode character (specified by its hexadecimal value) |

## Variables in Java

In Java, **variables** are used to store different types of values that can be changed during the program's execution. The data type of a variable defines what kind of value it can hold. Here's the syntax to define a variable:

```java
<access-modifier> <data-type> <name-of-the-variable> = <value>;
```

For example, consider the following variable declaration:

```java
private int number = 10;
```

In this example:
- `private` is the access modifier (you can use other modifiers like `public`, `protected`, or package-private).
- `int` is the data type (representing integers).
- `number` is the name of the variable.
- `10` is the initial value assigned to the variable.

## Constants in Java

A **constant** in Java is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned. To declare a constant, we use the `static` and `final` keywords. Here's the syntax to assign a constant value in Java:

```java
static final <data-type> <identifier-name> = <constant-value>;
```

For example, let's say we want to create a constant named `PI` to represent the mathematical constant Ï€ (approximately 3.14159). We can declare it as follows:

```java
public class MathConstants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("The value of PI is: " + PI);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `static` ensures that the variable is available without an instance of its defining class being loaded.
- `final` indicates that the value of `PI` cannot be changed.
- `double` is the data type.
- `3.14159` is the constant value assigned to `PI`.

Constants are useful for making your code more readable, maintaining consistency, and preventing accidental modifications.

# Loops in Java

Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of code until a certain condition is met. In Java, we have three types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

## For Loop

A `for` loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly. A `for` loop has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
Here's the syntax of a `for` loop:

```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```
```
public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0; // Initialize a variable

        // The while loop will run as long as 'i' is less than 5
        while (i < 5) {
            System.out.println(i); // Print the value of 'i'
            i++; // Increment 'i' by 1
        }
    }
}
```
# Example: Using a While Loop in Java

In this example, we demonstrate how to use a `while` loop in Java. The loop will continue executing the code block inside it as long as a specified condition remains true.

1. **Initialization**: We start with `i = 0`.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 5.
3. **Action**: The value of `i` is printed, and then `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
4. **Termination**: The loop stops when `i` becomes equal to or greater than 5.

Remember to increase the variable used in the condition (in this case, `i`) within the loop, otherwise, the loop will never end! ðŸ˜Š

Feel free to modify the condition and the code block inside the loop to suit your specific requirements! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! ðŸš€
